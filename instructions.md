## Overview

###### What is this project?

**Youâ€™ve come a long way, and it's time to show off your skills!** This will be your most advanced project to date, and it will most likely be the shining beacon of bragging rights for your portfolio thus far.

**You get to call the shots and invent your own idea**, choosing a framework and tools that are appropriate for what you want to build. Use everything you've learned so far, and **tackle something that'll push you a little outside of your comfort zone**.

Make sure it's **something you can accomplish in the limited time we have**, and make sure it's **something that will be visually impressive**.

**You can work on this project individually, but you may elect to work in groups.** See the [project planning deliverables](#planning--deliverables).

---

## Goals

###### What are my options?

There are multiple broad goals you can choose from. You need to pick a **minimum** of one or more goals from this list:

#### Recommended Goals:

* **Develop a MERN stack application** to solidify your knowledge around the technologies learned in class. (MongoDB Express React Node).

* **Develop a MEN stack application** to solidify your knowledge around the technologies learned in class. (MongoDB Express Node w/ EJS templates).

* **Polished portfolio piece:** Showcase substantial work in an area of interest by creating a highly polished product that will illustrate your skills, interests, and will be an anchor for your portfolio.


#### Alternative Goals:
* **Learn a new tech:** Create an application in a language or framework you have a strong interest in learning. (Python, Ruby on Rails, TypeScript, Django, etc.)
* **Develop an ambitious project:** This MVP for this project could serve as the basis for a larger project post-cohort
  * **Discover or invent an idea**, preferably one with some group of users that would jump at the chance to really use your product.
  * **Design a product *you* want to build**, and choose _appropriate technologies_ to build it.
  * **Pitch your idea** to your classmates and instructors, and incorporate their feedback.

---

## Technical Requirements

**Your app must meet the following technical requirements:**

* **Create a focused product**. Know which features are essential to build for your MVP and which to set aside for later.
* **Craft thoughtful user stories** that are significant enough to help you ensure a pleasing and logical user experience.
* **Handle errors gracefully**, and provide useful feedback to users when errors or validation failures do occur.
* **Focus on writing solid, real-world code** that is well-documented and DRY.
* **Make a product that's impressive-looking**; up your design and style game to kick your portfolio up a notch.


---

## Further Exploration

###### What if I want to do more?

* **Allow users to upload images from their desktop to your app** using a library like [Uploadcare](https://uploadcare.com/) 
* **Add additional models** to allow your application to handle more complex data needs.
* **Incorporate an external API** to add data and functionality to your application.
* **Use a data visualization library** to help users understand your core data.
* **Implement third-party log in** to allow users to access data from other services.
* **Build something you can really launch**, and recruit an actual user-base.
* **Test** critical components of your code to ensure that it works.
* Possible technologies to base a learning project around:
  * **Disclaimer!** For many of these techs, you will be responsible for, and on your own for learning and integrating them into an application! Some of these technologies may be difficult and/or very involved. Your final project as a result will not be as polished of a portfolio piece as a MERN stack application would be.
  * [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) Alternative front-end framework to React
  * [Angular](https://angular.io/) Alternative front-end framework to React
  * [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/api) Create a real e-commerce website by using the Stripe API in test mode!
  * [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) A Data visualization library
  * [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) To make an entire full-stack application in python using a single framework
  * [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) To replace your express backend with a python server.
  * [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) Use SQL for your database using Sequelize rather than MongoDB
  * [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) Create map-based interfaces
  * Test-Driven Development with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
  * The [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) programming language
  * CSS Frameworks such as [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)
  * Machine Learning with [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
  * [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) for React on mobile devices (Warning, very involved)
  * Realtime data with web sockets using [socket.io](https://socket.io/)
  * [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) An alternative paradigm to REST for creating APIs that provide data 
  * [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) A full-stack web framework using the Ruby language 

ðŸ™Œ This is an exciting opportunity to use your newly developed skills as a software engineer and **code to learn**. ðŸ™Œ

## Planning & Deliverables

###### What will I be turning in?

## Project Planning Soft Pitch Deliverables
Spend time either solo or with your team researching and exploring ideas and technologies.

Come up with **three project ideas** and answer the following questions for each of them:

1. What is your goal for this project? Please select one or more goals from the [project goals list](#goals)!
2. Who is the user for your app and how will they use your application? Prepare some user stories!
3. Are you incorporating any bonus technologies or APIs? If so, how do you plan on learning/implementing these techs?

---

## Project Planning Hard Pitch Deliverables

**You should review the following with your instructional team BEFORE you start to code. For your Hard Pitch, you will need to present all of the following documentation.**

* **Scope:** A one paragraph write-up of your idea. What do you reasonably think you can implement in the time period?

* **User Stories:** Who is your user? What features will your app have? Set up your project and user stories in <a href="https://trello.com" target="_blank">Trello</a>. Prioritize your user stories and make a clear distinction between what will be MVP and what will be stretch goals.

* **Wireframes:** Sketch out what your core pages will look like and how they will work. Consider making a *paper prototype* to demonstrate and/or test key user interactions.

* **Data Models:** Draw out the models and any associations for your project in an entity relationship diagram (ERD).

* **Feasibility Study:** If you're using an external API or scraping a website, make sure you can get that data. If you're using a new language, framework, or tool, go through its getting started tutorial. We *will* ask to see your results.

**Optional**
* **Milestones:** Divide your work into parts - the most essential features for your MVP, features that are important but not essential, and features that can be saved for a later iteration. Create 3-5 major milestones with dates outlining when you expect essential features will be done.

<details>
  <summary>When planning and throughout the development process remember to break the work into manageable chunks. Start small and focus implementing one feature at a time.</summary>

## Completed Project Deliverables

* A **working application that satisfies a user's need - a minimum viable product**
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with frequent commits dating back to the beginning of the project.
* **A `README.md` file** with:
  * A **link to your hosted working app**.
  * A paragraph-long **description** (elevator pitch) of your project.
  * A list of the **technologies used**.
  * A list of **installation steps** for the app itself and any dependencies - how would another developer run your site locally?
  * Link to your **user stories** - who are your users, what do they want, and why?
  * Link to your **wireframes** â€“ sketches of major views / interfaces in your application.
  * Link to your **entity relationship diagrams** â€“ plan out your data relationships before coding.
  * Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **future features**.
